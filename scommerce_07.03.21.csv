,Bipartisan Surface Transportation Legislation Passed by Committee Lays Foundation for Comprehensive Infrastructure Investment Package, ,
,Cantwell Also Pushes for Support on Safety and Workforce Issues, ,
,WASHINGTON, D.C.— ,U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA), the Chair of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, held a hearing today to consider four Biden Administration transportation nominees, some of whom will have roles in the implementation of the infrastructure package Congress is currently considering. Today’s nominees included the Honorable Jennifer L. Homendy, of Virginia, to be Chair of the National Transportation Safety Board; Ms. Karen J. Hedlund, of Colorado, to be a Member of the Surface Transportation Board; Dr. Robert C. Hampshire, of Michigan, to be Assistant Secretary for Research and Technology at the  Department of Transportation; and Ms. Carol A. Petsonk, of the District of Columbia, to be Assistant Secretary for Aviation and International Affairs at the Department of Transportation.,
,“Last week the committee voted on and passed the ,Surface Transportation Investment Act,…”, Cantwell said. ,“This important bipartisan legislation makes a $78 billion down payment on rebuilding and revamping our nation's critical infrastructure, a key to our economic future and creating jobs. Together, this committee succeeded in passing legislation that makes infrastructure investment that we need to be competitive in a global marketplace, and some of the nominees that we are going to hear from today are going to help confirm that role.”, ,
,Holding up a copy of the Seattle Times front page, Cantwell added: ,“…the front page at the Seattle Times is ‘Bounty of Containers Stresses Ports.’ So we've been saying that this is one of the reasons why we need an infrastructure bill because this level of increase in freight throughout, really the United States--my colleagues are probably seeing other things but this report says handling of 330,000 shipping containers has grown 38% compared to May 2020. So, these are problems that we hope to address…”,
,Ms. Hedlund discussed the freight congestion issue that Chair Cantwell raised in her opening statement. ,“I think the role of the STB is to gather information and to work collaboratively with other parts of the government to see if we can solve this problem,,”, Ms. Hedlund said. ,“It is a very serious issue, you’ve seen pictures of 40 tankers out there on the Port of Los Angeles, the Port of Long Beach waiting to unload their containers.”,

,“Obviously, the concerns of this committee on aerospace and aerospace safety remain paramount,,”, Chair Cantwell said when discussing Ms. Homendy’s nomination. ,“This is an issue, like in all areas of automation and human response, whether we're talking about the rail sector or the automobile sector the aviation sector, we believe we need to give specific focus to this and so I look forward to hearing how you hope to use the NTSB to work with us on the legislation that we most recently passed, which called for safety trend reports to make sure that the most urgent safety needs are constantly being addressed.”,
,“Leading the department's research and development on technology programs will be very much needed and very important,,”, Chair Cantwell said to Dr. Hampshire. ,“The department's research efforts are key to advancing innovation and technology developments across the transportation sector, and helping develop a skilled interdisciplinary transportation workforce for the nation.”,
,And finally, when addressing Ms. Petsonk, Chair Cantwell said, ,“As we all know, building and reengaging our global partners on international cooperation for aviation safety standards that protect all of the flying public is also a big priority for our committee.”,

"June 21, 2021",Chair Cantwell Statement on Supreme Court Decision on College Athletics,https://www.commerce.senate.gov/2021/6/chair-cantwell-statement-on-supreme-court-decision-on-college-athletics,"WASHINGTON, D.C. –, Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation Chair Maria Cantwell (D-WA) released the following statement following the Supreme Court’s decision in ,National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) vs. Alston,.,
,“Today’s ruling from the Supreme Court makes clear that the status quo in college athletics is untenable. Student athletes are the ones creating tremendous value and providing entertainment for millions with their talent, hard work and skill—and NCAA policies must reflect that reality.  This decision gives new urgency to the bipartisan work we are doing to set a nationwide standard for student athletes that gives them control of their Name, Image and Likeness (NIL) as well as providing additional health benefits and standards.”,
,###"
"June 17, 2021",Chair Cantwell: “Congress Cannot Pass an NIL Law That Just Ignores the Rights of Students.”,https://www.commerce.senate.gov/2021/6/chair-cantwell-congress-cannot-pass-an-nil-law-that-just-ignores-the-rights-of-students,"WASHINGTON, D.C. –, Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation Chair Maria Cantwell (D-WA) convened a hearing to hear the voices of student-athletes as Congress debates legislation giving athletes more rights including control over their Name, Image and Likeness (NIL).,
,“Last week we heard from legal experts from the NCAA, a coach, and other individuals who talked about this,”, Chair Cantwell said. ,“But there is so much more to be done. Congress cannot pass an NIL law that just ignores the rights of students. It also has to hear, I believe, about the experiences in healthcare and scholarship that make important rights issues so central to this debate.”,
,Chair Cantwell heard from Christina Chenault, a former Division I Track & Field athlete at UCLA, about the need for a federal law, to ensure the health, safety, and rights of student-athletes are protected. ,“I think there definitely needs to be a national bill put in place,”, Chenault said.  ,“[T]he autonomy can't be put in place just for the institutions to take up individually. When that happens, especially in a system where athletes do not have the power within this system, the athletes are always going to be put on the backburner, or put at a state of disadvantage. So I think there should be a widespread bill that, like Mr. McNair stated, from a health and safety standpoint, can take the precedent of [the] Maryland [law].”,
,Cantwell also asked Chenault to describe the fear of retribution student athletes experience when pushed by their coaches to compete, even while injured: ,“Do you think that people knew who to go to talk to at the university besides the coaching team?, ,Did you think of anybody that you could go to and approach at the university?”  ,
,“I don't think athletes really trust that many professionals at the institution,”, Chenault answered. ,“I think there's a big fear from athletes that it will all come back to their coaches, or in some way, have a financial implication on their end, regarding their scholarship or playing time or whatever the case may be, that will limit their ability to play or do what they love to do., “,
,
,CLICK HERE, AND HERE TO WATCH CANTWELL EXCHANGE WITH MS. CHENAULT,
,Sari Cureton, a former Division I Women’s Basketball player at Georgetown University, agreed saying, ,“As long as we put athletes first and we prioritize their right to monetize their NIL, and when we’re considering restrictions and things like that, I think that's the most important approach to a national legislation.”,
,
,CLICK HERE, TO WATCH CANTWELL EXCHANGE WITH MS. CURETON, ,
,Cantwell also focused on the importance of addressing student athletes’ mental health in her questioning with the witnesses. Ms. Chenault stressed,, “For one, I think mental health shouldn't be reactive, it definitely has to be proactive… And the second thing is, I do think the psychologist should be catered specifically to the athlete, whether it's by sport, whether it's a sports psychologist specifically, or whether it's just the representation of gender or race as an availability or option for these athletes to be able to go to, so that is not just ‘one person fits all’ within mental health.”,
,Ms. Cureton followed up on that point saying that while there was a woman on the athletic staff while she was at Georgetown,, “I think there also needs to be better safeguards in place on educating staff and coaches about the mental health needs of the athletes that they’re serving, so it needs to be proactive on every front… So I think that needs to be a change and a shift in the perspective and how we look at mental health in athletics.”,
,
,CLICK HERE, TO WATCH FULL EXCHANGE ON MENTAL HEALTH,
,Mr. McNair, who tragically lost his son to heat stroke, also weighed in on the appropriate safeguards that need to be in place for student athletes.,
,“So there were plans in place, but they needed to be practiced and executed consistently,”, Mr. McNair said. ,“So in the event that something does happen, we'll know what to do. Now, not only that, but again, student athletes need to know if the peak times they need to know their bodies and things of that nature.”,
, ,
,CLICK HERE, TO WATCH CANTWELL EXCHANGE WITH MR. MCNAIR, ,
,The hearing also covered some of the concerns that have been expressed regarding the implementation of NIL. Ms. Brown addressed the concerns of those seeking to limit NIL rights in the name of “protecting” students.,
,
,“Rather than letting the institution limit how we can use our name, image, and likeness,” ,Ms. Brown said. ,“I think… we could be allowed to learn I think about how NIL would work and be given workshops and that sort of thing, but I don't think we should be limited in terms of how we can use it. Maybe just taught or guided in terms of how best it could work.”,

,“I’m very pleased to congratulate Ms. Khan on her confirmation to the Federal Trade Commission,”, said Chair Cantwell. ,“Her confirmation comes at a critical time for our nation as consumers have spent more time online than ever before during the pandemic, from connecting with loved ones, or staying on top of the news, to making a living by working remotely. As I said during Ms. Khan’s nomination hearing before the Commerce Committee: I believe in the promise of the internet and the information age, but I also believe that we need a policeman – or in this case – a policewoman – on the beat. That is the FTC’s core mission. We must protect consumers from the frauds and scams that have proliferated during the pandemic. We must protect their privacy and renew our focus on cybersecurity– both of which are essential to protecting our national security and infrastructure. And we have to do everything we can to help stabilize the local news ecosystem which has been severely impacted by unfair practices by the major internet advertising platforms. I look forward to working with Ms. Khan and the FTC on these critical issues.”,

"December 13, 2007",Inouye Applauds Senate Passage of Historic Fuel Economy Legislation,https://www.commerce.senate.gov/2007/12/inouye-applauds-senate-passage-of-historic-fuel-economy-legislation,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Commerce Committee Chairman Daniel K. Inouye (D-Hawaii) delivered the following statement today on the floor of the U.S. Senate just before passage of the ,Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007,. ,
, ,
,“Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Renewable Consumer and Energy Efficiency Act of 2007. After months of constructive negotiations, we have successfully crafted thoughtful and rich bipartisan agreement, particularly in Title I, otherwise known as the ‘Ten-in-Ten’ Fuel Economy Act. Title I would mandate an increase in automobile fuel economy to a nation-wide fleet average of 35 miles per gallon by 2020. In addition, the Department of Transportation would adopt fuel economy standards for medium and heavy duty commercial vehicles for the first time.,
, ,
,“Today’s agreement marks historic progress: This is the first statutory increase in fuel economy standards for cars since 1975. Reducing our dependence on foreign oil is of vital importance to our national security, economic stability, and consumer welfare; the Ten-in-Ten Fuel Economy Act is a major step forward in achieving these goals.  ,
, ,
,“Title I of the bill will save approximately 1.1 million barrels of oil per day in 2020, equal to one half of what we currently import daily from the Persian Gulf. By the year 2020, the legislation will save consumers approximately $22 billion at the pump and prevent approximately 200 million metric tons of greenhouse gases from polluting our environment each year. By dramatically reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2020, Title I would demonstrate to the world that America is a leader in fighting global warming.,
, ,
,“Legislation of this magnitude could have only been achieved through the hard work of a coalition of Members. In this case, without Senators Feinstein, Stevens, Snowe, Kerry, Dorgan, Lott, Carper, Boxer, Durbin, Alexander, Corker, and Cantwell, the agreement would not have been reached. ,
, ,
,“In particular, I wish to congratulate Senator Feinstein on her efforts in developing this bill. Her dedication over the years has led to a public policy that very few thought possible.  I would also like to praise the efforts of my good friend Senator Stevens, who was instrumental in forging the compromise before us. I also would like to thank Chairman Dingell and Senators Levin and Stabenow for their hard work and willingness to achieve an agreement that aggressively improves fuel economy while protecting domestic automobile manufacturing and U.S. workers. The American automaker and autoworker have no better champions. ,
, ,
,“In addition, the tireless efforts of groups dedicated to conservation and improving national security were vital to enacting this legislation. Of special note is the support of a non-partisan group of business executives and retired senior military leaders concerned about global energy security, known as Securing America’s Future Energy (SAFE). I am grateful for the support and hard work of its leaders Frederick W. Smith and General P.X. Kelley, as well as Robbie Diamond, who served as their liaison. The Union of Concerned Scientists, David Friedman in particular, provided significant technical support and advocacy for the Ten-in-Ten Fuel Economy Act.    ,
, ,
,“Finally, Mr. President, I would like to express my appreciation to all the hard working members of the staff who worked to make this historical legislation a reality. In particular, I would like to commend David Strickland, Alex Hoehn-Saric, Mia Petrini, and Jared Bomberg of my Commerce Committee staff for a job well done. ,
, ,
,“The importance of this legislation cannot be underestimated. During the Arab oil embargo in 1973, Americans suffered the first devastating effects of our addiction to oil. Born out of this embargo, Congress put in place a fuel economy program that nearly doubled the gas mileage of cars from 1975 to 1985.  Passage of this bill will ensure that our nation’s energy priorities start moving in the right direction again.  ,
, ,
,“Higher fuel economy standards will wean the country of its oil addiction, put billions of dollars of savings back into our domestic economy, and significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions.,
, ,
,“A diverse group of constituencies support the Ten-in-Ten Fuel Economy Act, from environmentalists to automotive workers and automakers. While it sets forth aggressive standards, the Act also recognizes the challenges faced by the auto industry and ensures that those concerns will be addressed.  Providing flexibility to the automotive industry, the sponsors of these fuel economy provisions have worked together in a bipartisan manner to ensure that automakers have the tools they need to meet the requirements enumerated in the Act.  The Ten-in-Ten Fuel Economy Act directs the Secretary of Transportation to create two fuel economy curves, one for passenger cars and one for light trucks.  ,
,This change from the Senate–passed bill provides the certainty that American automakers, auto workers, and car dealers requested, but the Act still requires that the combined car and light truck fleet meet a fuel economy standard of at least 35 miles per gallon by 2020.     ,
, ,
,“Our actions today will improve national security, create jobs, help consumers, and protect the environment. At times it is the government’s responsibility to balance conflicting interests. Today, I believe we found that balance.”,

, ,
,
, ,
,Senator Stevens:  ,I thank my colleagues, Senators Lieberman and Collins for working with the Commerce Committee to include important security measures in this bill.  And, I’m very grateful to my great friend, Senator Inouye, for his willingness to work in our committee on a bipartisan basis to develop and report these measures.    ,
,
,In the five and a half years since the horrific events of September 11,th,, we have made many improvements in the security of our nation’s transportation infrastructure and ensured communications interoperability. ,
,
,Our job is far from over, whether it’s more improvements to be made or gaps to close.  In matters of security, we must not become complacent – as our enemies adapt, so must we.  ,
,
,The Commerce Committee’s aviation and surface transportation security legislation, which have been included in S. 4 – will significantly enhance the ability of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), to fulfill their missions.  These provisions were developed by the Commerce Committee while mindful of the delicate balance between implementing tough security measures and the effect such regulations may have on the nation’s economy and the movement of goods. ,

,The aviation provisions incorporated into S. 4 were reported by the Commerce Committee on February 13,th, as S. 509, the Aviation Security Improvement Act of 2007.  The provisions incorporate aviation-related 9/11 commission recommendations, and provide TSA with additional tools to carry out its layered approach to security.  ,
,
,To do this, the aviation security provisions dedicate continued funding for the installation of in-line explosive detection systems utilized for the enhanced screening of checked baggage at our nation’s airports.  ,
,
,We all recognize the importance of screening 100 percent of cargo transported to and within the ,.  Last year, in the
,
SAFE
,
Port Act, Congress acted to ensure that all cargo arriving in the by sea is screened.  In S. 4, we ensure that 100 percent of air cargo also is screened.  The air cargo supply chain handles over 50,000 tons of cargo each day, of which 26 percent is designated for domestic passenger carriers.  ,
,
,Screening is particularly important in ,
,
Alaska .  ,Anchorage, my home, is the number one airport in the for landed weight of cargo, and it is number three in the world for cargo throughput.  Our provision would require TSA to develop and implement a system to provide for the screening of all cargo being carried by passenger aircraft. ,
,
,To address on-going concerns about passenger pre-screening procedures, the legislation requires DHS to create an “Office of Appeals and Redress” to establish a timely and fair process for airline passengers who believe they have been misidentified against the “No-Fly” or “Selectee” watch lists.  ,
,
,TSA’s “layered approach to security” relies not only upon equipment and technological advances, but also upon improved security screening techniques employed by the TSA screeners as well as the very effective use of canines.  This legislation calls for TSA’s National Explosives Detection Canine Team to deploy more of these valuable resources across the nation’s transportation network. ,
,
,The bill we are considering also contains the provisions of S. 184, the Surface Transportation and Rai,l Security Act of 2007, which was also developed and reported on a bipartisan basis by the Commerce Committee., ,
,
,While the aviation industry has received most of the attention and funding for security, the rail and transit attacks in , , and all point to a common strategy utilized by terrorists.  The openness of our surface transportation network presents unique security challenges.  The vastness of these systems requires targeted allocation of our resources based on risk.  ,
,
,Most of the surface transportation security provisions in the bill before the Senate today have been included previously as part of other transportation security bills introduced by Senator Inouye, Senator McCain, and myself.  Many of the provisions in the substitute amendment passed the Senate unanimously last year, as well as in the 108,th, Congress.  Each time, however, the House of Representatives did not agree to the need to address rail, pipeline, motor carrier, hazardous materials and other over-the-road security.  The time has come to send these provisions to the President’s desk.  We’re hopeful the House will agree this time. ,
,
,The substitute also contains the provisions of the Commerce Committee-reported measure, S. 385, the Interoperable Emergency Communications Act.  Since 2001, we have heard the cries of public safety officials that the police, firefighters and emergency medical response personnel throughout the country need help achieving interoperability. ,
,
,With this $1 billion program that helps every state, public safety will be able to move forward with real solutions and begin addressing the problems that have plagued our nation’s first responders for too long. ,
,
,The legislation addresses all of the public safety issues that have been brought to the Commerce Committee’s attention.  It also includes $100 million to establish both Federal and State strategic technology reserves that will restore communications quickly in disasters equal in scale to hurricanes Katrina and Rita.  ,
,
,We must not politicize national security.  The Commerce Committee’s provisions included in this bill are very important, and I urge their adoption.  Again, I thank very much the cooperation of the Homeland Security Government Affairs Committee. We achieved our reported bills that I have mentioned here from the Commerce Committee because of the bipartisanship in our Committee.  I hope that this debate on this important bill before the Senate will continue in that same spirit.  The American people really expect and deserve nothing less.

,By Sen. Jay Rockefeller,
,Roll Call,
,Feb. 5, 2014,
,
,At any given moment during any given day, hundreds of thousands of drivers in the United States are using their phones while behind the wheel — talking, texting or searching for information — and endangering their lives and the lives of those around them. Technology may be part of our daily habits, but using these devices while driving is becoming a fatal vice that threatens to undo the remarkable progress we have made to improve highway safety. According to the National Safety Council, as many as a quarter of today’s automobile crashes involve drivers talking or texting on their phones, and there is no sign of the problem abating.,
,Surveys show that nearly all Americans know the perils of distracted driving — that texting behind the wheel, for instance, makes it 23 times more likely that they will be involved in a crash. Yet the temptations to use electronic devices, and the resulting tragedies, persist.,
,Auto companies and the software industry are now eagerly developing in-car “infotainment” systems that offer ever-more connectivity and features to mirror the temptations of our smartphones. They say consumers are demanding constant connectivity in the car, and that these systems are safer than the alternatives. Further, they claim transferring such functionalities from the phone to the built-in system will reduce distractions and increase our safety because drivers will put down their phones.,
,Despite these new advances, I reject this “lesser of two evils” reasoning that, because in-car infotainment systems are supposedly safer than hand-held smartphones, they belong in cars. Lost amid this focus on a technological solution is careful consideration of whether these onboard systems should, in fact, replicate so much of the connectivity — a lot of it completely unrelated to driving — that we have on smartphones. For instance, I see no reason drivers should be able to update their social-media profiles or compare restaurant and hotel reviews while behind the wheel. Furthermore, researchers have shown that distractions come in different forms, and, while these in-car systems can reduce the amount of time that the drivers’ hands and eyes are off the wheel and the road, attention can still dangerously wander. ,
,In contrast to the current industry approach, I believe we should be leveraging the technology in our cars and harnessing the same ingenuity to reduce distracted driving, rather than creating new forms of distraction. Many drivers may, in fact, prefer to limit their distractions while they are on the road. And many parents would like the ability to establish such limitations for teen drivers in their family. Perhaps we should be looking to limit the functionality of mobile and built-in technologies, rather than accommodate them.,
,I strongly believe phones should be capable of automatically limiting functionalities while in the car, whether the phones are connected to the in-car systems or not. We know that technological means of accomplishing this already exist, but they are not widely available and do not seamlessly operate across software platforms. Mobile device-makers, software developers, automakers and wireless carriers should be working collaboratively now to remove these obstacles. This is a problem that cannot be solved by just one industry alone, and I would like to see broad cooperation across the spectrum of stakeholders.,
,Later this week, I am convening a summit on this critical public safety matter and bringing all of the key industries to the same table and pushing them to act — and to act now. Over the course of my chairmanship of the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, I have dedicated significant attention to protecting Americans on our nation’s roadways. Yes, the car has never been safer, and technology has been a key ingredient in that success, but this progress is being undermined by the glut of nonessential technology that has nothing to do with the task of driving. ,
,It is my hope and expectation that the summit will spur industries to proactively seek technological solutions that can be widely adopted, readily available, and highlight to the public the life-or-death matter of staying focused behind the wheel.,

"October 16, 2007",The Digital Revolution Must Be Televised Nationwide,https://www.commerce.senate.gov/2007/10/the-digital-revolution-must-be-televised-nationwide,"The Hill Special Report: Telecom - A revolution is coming to television sets across this country.  On February 17, 2009–less than 500 days away–television broadcasters will switch from analog to digital signals.  For viewers, this change holds tremendous promise.  By migrating to digital, they can enjoy dramatically sharper pictures and crisper sound.  Broadcasters now offering a single channel of analog programming will be able to develop multiple digital channels, with more regional news, weather, children’s fare, and content for non-English speakers.  On top of this, the switch to digital means more efficient use of our airwaves, opening up more spectrum for our nation’s first responders.
,
,
,The rewards of a successful digital television (DTV) transition are enormous.  Like in any revolution, however, these rewards come with an undercurrent of risk.  As many as 21 million households rely exclusively on over-the-air television.  These households risk seeing their sets go dark.  So do millions more that have one or more analog sets that are not connected to either cable or satellite service.  Yet a recent poll from the National Association of Broadcasters suggests that only 1 in 10 Americans know when the digital transition is coming.  
,
,
,To ensure success, we must draw up a battle plan.  At the federal level, this responsibility falls principally on the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA).
,
,
,The FCC is charged with managing the airwaves used by our nation’s broadcasters.  It must act decisively to ensure that broadcasters are fully prepared for the switch.  It also must ensure that consumers are not only generally informed about the DTV transition, but also are given information tailored to advise them about changes occurring in the communities where they live.
,
,
,The NTIA is in charge of the government program that, beginning January 1, 2008, will allow consumers to request up to two $40 coupons per household to defray the cost of digital-to-analog converter boxes.  These boxes make it possible for consumers who rely on over-the-air service to continue to receive television broadcasts.  Without them, their sets could cease to work.  But with three months to go, the NTIA program is plagued by uncertainties.  It is not clear which boxes have been certified and which retailers will stock them on their shelves.  
,
,
,Getting these boxes in the hands of consumers is a challenge.  Getting the word out is even more daunting.  Yet to date, efforts on the outreach front have been patchy.  The FCC is in the early stages of reaching out to at-risk populations.  The NTIA has $5 million to spend on consumer outreach, but its efforts have barely begun.  Making a complicated situation even more difficult, the General Accountability Office (GAO) has suggested the absence of federal action is raising questions about who has ultimate authority for the switch.  In the ominous words of a recent GAO witness:  “It’s pretty clear to us that there is no one in charge.”
,
,
,The time has come to manage the mechanics of the transition with the American public in mind.  First, to get this done right, the Administration should establish a federal, interagency DTV Task Force, co-chaired by leadership at the FCC and NTIA.  The DTV Task Force would determine how best to marshal existing resources across the federal government and advise Congress as to what additional measures may be necessary to ensure a smooth transition.  A similar structure was used successfully to coordinate federal action in addressing the Y2K problem.  
,
,
,Second, as we develop this national effort, it is imperative that we match our work with local needs and strategies.  National messages will only take us so far.  What works in Houston may not work in Honolulu.  Questions about the impact of broadcast tower construction, the presence of translator stations, and the need for antennas will require local answers.  We need the equivalent of DTV “block captains” ready, willing, and able in every media market in this country.  
,
,
,Finally, we must enhance transparency and accountability for the digital transition.  Indeed, success will require that we regularly measure data in each television market.  As part of this assessment, the DTV Task Force should consider ways of collecting and reporting granular data that will validate successful strategies and provide early warning when we are at risk of running off the rails.  
,
,
,The countdown to February 17, 2009 is on.  For the revolution to yield benefits for viewers across the country, the time to act is now.

"February 7, 2007",THE HILL OP-ED: Communications issues still need Congress’s attention ,https://www.commerce.senate.gov/2007/2/the-hill-op-ed-communications-issues-still-need-congress’s-attention,"As our nation moves farther into the digital age, there are several important issues that Congress should consider which will dramatically affect the way millions of Americans communicate. These issues include reforming universal service, easing the transition to digital television, and encouraging Internet access.,,,All Americans deserve the advantages presented by essential communications, and telemedicine and distance learning are especially important to rural America. To encourage the deployment of such services, we must maintain and reform the universal service program, which helps connect the entire nation. An important and overdue first step is the USA Act (S.101 – the Universal Service for Americans Act), which mirrors language contained in the comprehensive communications bill reported out of the Senate Commerce Committee last year.,,,The USA Act would place all communications companies on a level playing field, acknowledging new technologies and lowering the burden on industry. The bill ensures continued support for schools and libraries to provide broadband Internet access to students, library patrons and health clinics (including rural pharmacies). Additionally, it creates a program to support the expansion of broadband Internet access in underserved areas. More will need to be done, but these measures are desperately needed to ensure access to communications for all Americans so our nation does not lose its technological edge.,,,Basic communications services for Americans are not the only issues that need to be addressed. A sea change is coming in the way Americans watch television, especially for those who receive broadcast signals over the air. Last year, the Senate set a hard date for the transition from analog television broadcasting to digital television broadcasting. This transition will allow broadcast spectrum to be devoted to emergency interoperable communications for police, firemen, paramedics and other first responders.,,,Also, pursuant to the digital transition law, valuable broadcast spectrum will be auctioned and proceeds will fund a converter box program to ease the digital transition for consumers. Auction proceeds will also fund important grants for public safety and first responders. To help with the transition, the National Association of Broadcasters is launching a massive education campaign to ensure consumers are aware of the coming change and are prepared for the switch to digital signals.,,,The Internet is an increasingly vital part of our daily lives, and Congress must work to ensure that we do not hinder its growth. It is imperative that the government find ways to encourage the deployment of broadband throughout the nation and promote increased Internet access for all Americans. The digital television transition, which passed last Congress, will free up valuable spectrum for increased broadband Internet deployment.,,,The FCC has also played an important part in this goal by recently approving an item that will speed the deployment of advanced networks by telephone companies. Such networks will provide competition for cable companies, and reduce prices. These networks will also increase quality television programming and offer Americans even faster Internet access. Congress can also play a role in supporting improved Internet access by extending the Internet Tax Freedom Act, which will expire on Nov. 1, 2007.,,,As Congress addresses these pressing communications issues, it should not get sidetracked by theoretical problems. Some members of Congress would impose net regulation in an era of unprecedented investment, innovation and job creation. I continue to support the right of every broadband consumer to access all legal content on the Internet. But behind flashy catchphrases, special interests are pushing agendas that will not solve the communications issues that require immediate attention. In fact, both Robert Kahn and David Farber, known as the father and grandfather of the Internet, are firmly opposed to sweeping regulation of the Internet.,,,The Internet has not only existed, but flourished without unnecessary government intervention. It is my hope that special interests do not succeed in denying consumers the benefits of communications technology, investment, innovation and jobs.,,,Stevens is the ranking member of the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee.,"

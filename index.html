This hearing will examine the urgency of implementing aviation safety, certification, and oversight reforms mandated by the Aircraft, Certification, Safety, and Accountability Act (“ACSAA”) of 2020. The Committee will discuss the approach of the Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) to effectuating ACSAA and its work to implement provisions of the legislation in accordance with congressionally-mandated timelines.

Children and teens face immense peer pressure to be on apps such as Snapchat, TikTok, and YouTube. While social media can provide entertainment and educational opportunities, these apps have also been misused to harm kids and promote destructive acts, such as vandalism in schools, deadly viral challenges, bullying, eating disorders, manipulative influencer marketing, and grooming. This hearing will examine how tech companies treat young audiences, including how algorithms and product design choices can amplify harms, addiction, and intrusions into privacy. The hearing will also explore needed improvements to our laws to protect children and teenagers online.  \r\n</td>

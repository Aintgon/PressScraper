      <td>Washington, D.C. — House Energy and Commerce Committee Republicans sent a letter to Committee Chairman Frank Pallone (D-NJ) on Friday requesting the Committee schedule oversight hearings with the Department of Energy (DOE) to address the energy crisis and preparations for the upcoming winter. Americans are facing rapidly rising and unaffordable energy prices, which is harming the economy and driving up inflation and household bills.
